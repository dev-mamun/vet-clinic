--Find a way to decrease the execution time of the first query
CREATE INDEX idx_animal_id ON visits (animal_id);
--Configure the query cache size in your MySQL configuration file:
query_cache_size = 128M
--Enable the query cache by setting the following parameter to 1:
query_cache_type = 1
--Add a duplicate animal_id column to the visits table:
ALTER TABLE visits ADD duplicate_animal_id INT;
--Update the duplicate_animal_id column with the corresponding values from the animal_id column:
UPDATE visits SET duplicate_animal_id = animal_id;
--Index the new column for faster retrieval:
CREATE INDEX idx_duplicate_animal_id ON visits (duplicate_animal_id);
--Create a partitioned table for the visits table:
CREATE TABLE visits_partitioned (
    animal_id INT,
    -- Other columns
) PARTITION BY LIST (animal_id);
--Create individual partitions for each animal_id value:
CREATE TABLE visits_p1 PARTITION OF visits_partitioned FOR VALUES IN (1);
CREATE TABLE visits_p2 PARTITION OF visits_partitioned FOR VALUES IN (2);
--Create a materialized view that computes the result of the query:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW visits_count_mv AS
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM visits WHERE animal_id = 4;
--Refresh the materialized view periodically to update the result:
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW visits_count_mv;
